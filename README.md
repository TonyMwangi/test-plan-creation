## TEST PLAN CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

* In this assessment, you are being asked to develop a test plan for a software product. 
You should start (as any good testing process should) by reading and understanding the <h5>software requirements specification (SRS)</h5>.
This project's SRS is contained within the document 'golfsrsrev.pdf' and should be considered to be finished.

* After reading the SRS document, your primary task will be to develop a test plan for the project.
Using the template provided (within document <h5>'TestPlan_Template.docx' or 'TestPlan_Template.rtf'</h5>), 
complete the various sections of the test plan in order to appropriately plan for the testing of the software solution. 
Submit your test plan document as a PDF.

* Remember: it is your job to justify what is included (and not included) in your test plan.
Time estimates should be reasonable, with realistic parameters (even if they are assumptions) explained to justify scheduling. 

* Additionally, while typically test cases are not included in the test plan itself, but rather in a separate, 
stand-alone document of its own, we ask that you include the actual test cases you would use in your submission for the ease of evaluation. 
Either as an appendix or a distinct section of the test plan, you should include a brief but understandable test case (input and expected output).

* For example, here are four potential test cases for this project: <br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>The number of golf course '1' shall be accepted</td>
    <td>Functional</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>21</td>
     <td>The number of golf course '5' shall be accepted</td>
     <td>Functional</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>22</td>
     <td>The number of golf course '6' shall return an error</td>
     <td>Functional</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>23</td>
     <td>The number of golf course '0' shall return an error</td>
     <td>Functional</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For your convenience and study, a similar (though NOT identical in structure) test plan for another project is also included (within the document 'TestPlan_Example.pdf'). 
Refer to the lectures and this example for a better understanding of what to put in the test plan, how, and why. 
### Note: This example does not include the specific test cases within the document, but refers to them in an appendix. You will include your actual test cases in your submission.
